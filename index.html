  <p> <strong>Scientist with 6 years of postgraduate academic, and 7 years of biotech experience in creating
      <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> models aiding in mechanistic dissection of complex
      human diseases.</strong> <br>
    I have spent the last 21 years of my life, starting during my undergraduate degree, studying
    G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) pharmacology. The emphasis of my work has been to understand how
    biased agonist activation of GPCRs determines processes as small as kinetics of or specific engagement
    of cellular signaling cascades, up to and including full body <i>in vivo</i> physiological output.
    Along the way I've honed my skills in chosing (and establishing)
    cellular and animal models mechanistically predictive for dissecting the pathology of
    complex human diseases including substance abuse, chronic pain and metabolic disorders. I spent the last
    7 years in biotech leveraging my knowledge of biased GPCR pharmacology in drug development geared towards
    combating metabolic disorders, obesity and type 2 <i>diabetes mellitus</i> (T2DM).
    As part of the team at Carmot Therapeutics I contributed by
    establishing and running tests in cellular and in vivo models with predictive value for drug effects
    in metabolic disorders. The data obtained in these models made up the platform from which we launched
    the first clinical trials at the company.
